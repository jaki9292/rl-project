This [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jaki9292/rl-project/blob/main/project.ipynb) reports on a small project to compare the effectiveness of artificial agent algorithms ranging in sophistication from naive to deep reinforcement learning (Russell & Norvig, 2022; Sutton & Barto, 2018) to successfully land a virtual "lunar lander" in a Gymnasium (2022) model environment. After comparing the various models, I explore the effects of various hyperparameters on a deep Q-network model (Mnih et al., 2015).

See the [project.ipynb Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/jaki9292/rl-project/blob/main/project.ipynb) or [PDF](https://github.com/jaki9292/rl-project/blob/main/RL-Project-Kinkade.pdf) for the full report.
